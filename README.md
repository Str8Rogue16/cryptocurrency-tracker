# cryptocurrency-tracker
python crypto trackers project for tracker current price of Shibu Inu
This is a hackathon project and to learn python development and API calls.
Having some difficulties currently with loading some of the libraries that I am trying to call and proving difficult to currently test. 

Currently only focused on Shibu Inu but will be looking to add to this and add Doge tracking as well. 
Currently only looking at tracking real time prices but will be looking to add more functions and more currencies later on.
